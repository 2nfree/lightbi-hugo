## Extra Features

### Responsive

This theme is designed to look great on both large-screen and small-screen (mobile) devices.

### Google Analytics

To add Google Analytics, simply sign up to [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) to obtain your Google Tracking ID, and add this tracking ID to the `googleAnalytics` parameter in `config.toml`.

### Commit SHA on the footer

If the source of your site is in a Git repo, the SHA corresponding to the commit the site is built from can be shown on the footer. To do so, two site parameters `commit` has to be defined in the config file `config.toml`:

```
enableGitInfo = true
[Params]
  commit = "https://github.com/<username>/<siterepo>/tree/"
```

See at [vincenttam/vincenttam.gitlab.io](https://gitlab.com/vincenttam/vincenttam.gitlab.io) for an example of how to add it to a continuous integration system.
